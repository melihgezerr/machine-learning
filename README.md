## How to run ?

Initially, we've implemented everything with Jupyter Notebook files hence, we suggest using those files to reproduce results we have obtained in our report. However, we still generated plain python versions of those notebooks using a package called ``` nbconvert ```. You may use either of our versions to test our code.

There are some dependencies need to be installed before running the code. Name and versions of the dependencies reside in ``` requirements.txt ``` file. You can install desired dependencies using the command below (make sure you are under ```/Assignment\ 1 ``` folder ) :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies you can run Jupyter Notebooks individually (make sure you have selected your environment as your kernel). If you want to run python files individually, you can run them via using command below (make sure you are under the respective folder. For example, if you want to run ```pla.py``` you must be under the ```/pla``` folder. Otherwise make sure you modified the command below accordingly.) :

```
python3 file-name.py
```
